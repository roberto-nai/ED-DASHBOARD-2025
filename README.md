## Abstract

In the context of emergency medical care, timely and informed decision-making is critical for both clinical and operational efficiency. This work presents a four-step framework designed to support healthcare professionals and hospital management. Starting with real, anonymized data from hospital information systems (data level), the pipeline involves the application of process mining techniques for both the encoding and the embeddings of event logs (processing level), for predictions with Machine Learning, explainability, and LLM (modeling, analysis, and XAI level) to visualize and compare results for operational decision-making (reporting level). 
A prototype application was developed as a proof of concept within the emergency department of a medium-sized Italian hospital to support the analysis of patient flow and outcomes in a decision support context. The approach engaged healthcare stakeholders throughout the entire process, from initial development to the validation phase.
